# Prueba-Slidify

Dear Sir or Madam,

This is my submission for the slidify part of course project "Data products".
As I am not at all experienced in github I am not sure this is going to work well. 
However If you are reading these lines, you will be perhaps able to find in the "Prueba-Slidify" folder the "index.html" file
where my presentation can be visualized.
This is the third time I find more difficult the github work than the proper course project. I hope I will finally be an 
experienced github user (when I will grow up).
Thanks for reading my files.
Yours
JLVZ
